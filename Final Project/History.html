                <h2>Discrimination has been widely shown to have significant, harmful effects on health and well-being. The results<br> of the "Discrimination in America" survey show major variation in reports of personal experience with<br>discrimination because of race, gender, or LGBTQ identity, and can be viewed as the scientific backing for anecdotes<br>related to discrimination that surround us across a range of areas in everyday life.</h2>

                <h2>The most surprising thing about all this is that there are manily the two main active types of discrimination that are<br>more active than any other. The first of these is the one that has been around the longest that being racial discrimination.<br>Racism against various ethnic or minority groups has existed in the United States since the early colonial era. Before 1865,<br>most African Americans were enslaved and even afterwards, they have faced severe restrictions on their political, social,<br>and economic freedoms.<br><br>Just as well sexual discrimination has been a ongoning issue that was around for a lot longer starting with female inequality<br>then evolving into discrimination based on gender identity. Discrimination is a big problem that has cause many people<br>there lives not just body but in spirit as well. It is our job to make it clear to the world that we are all the same.</h2>
